# OCI Pipeline File Inventory and Branching Reference

This document is a reference for the `.tekton/` pipeline files across all three
in-scope OCI image repositories. It records the exact shape of the nightly
pipeline files and specifies the diff that must be applied when creating a
versioned Konflux branch. It drives Issues #24, #26, #27, and #28.

---

## Nightly component inventory

Five nightly components exist. Four are in scope for versioned release branching
automation; one is explicitly excluded (see the section below).

| Component | Repository | Default branch | In scope |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|
| `foreman-develop` | `theforeman/foreman-oci-images` | `master` | Yes |
| `foreman-proxy-develop` | `theforeman/foreman-oci-images` | `master` | Yes |
| `pulp-develop` | `theforeman/pulp-oci-images` | `master` | Yes |
| `candlepin-develop` | `theforeman/candlepin-oci-images` | `master` | Yes |
| `foreman-mcp-server-develop` | `theforeman/foreman-mcp-server` | — | **No** |

---

## foreman-mcp-server scope decision

`foreman-mcp-server-develop` is **explicitly excluded from versioned release
branching automation**.

Rationale: the MCP server has its own release cadence that is independent of the
Foreman RPM release cycle. Its OCI images do not need to be pinned to a specific
Foreman version number, and there is no expectation that a `foreman-mcp-server-3.x`
image would be released in lock-step with a Foreman 3.x release. Automating
versioned branches for this component would create maintenance overhead with no
corresponding value.

The component appears in `docs/release-logic.md` as a nightly component and
remains managed there; it is simply not touched by the branching scripts.

> ¹ The `{push,pull-request}` shorthand represents two separate CEL expressions: the push pipeline references only its own file (`.tekton/foreman-develop-push.yaml`), and the pull-request pipeline references only `.tekton/foreman-develop-pull-request.yaml`. The same convention applies to all components throughout this document.

**Containerfile version build args** (`images/foreman/Containerfile`):

**Containerfile version build args** (`images/candlepin/Containerfile`):

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=4.7
ARG VERSION_XYZ=4.7.4
```

Note: unlike foreman and pulp, the Candlepin Containerfile does **not** default
`VERSION` to `nightly`. The nightly build relies on the Konflux pipeline passing
the correct version build arg at build time.

---

## Image tag flow

For every component, the push pipeline builds two image references:

1. **Staging tag** (produced by `build-image-index`):
   `quay.io/foreman/<component>-stage:{{revision}}`
   This is an internal Konflux staging image used as input to the release pipeline.

2. **Nightly tag** (applied by the Konflux `push-to-external-registry` ReleasePlan):
   `quay.io/theforeman/<component>:nightly`
   This is the publicly consumed image.

The PR pipeline tags the staging image as `on-pr-{{revision}}` (commit SHA) and sets
`image-expires-after: 5d` so ephemeral PR images are cleaned up automatically.
The pull request number appears only in pipeline annotation metadata, not in the image tag.

---

## Versioned branch naming convention

When a new Foreman version (e.g., `3.19`) is released, a versioned branch is
created in each OCI image repository. The branch follows the pattern:

```
foreman-<VERSION>
```

Examples: `foreman-3.19`, `foreman-3.20`.

The Konflux Component name for the versioned build follows the pattern:

```
<image>-<VERSION>
```

Examples: `foreman-3.19`, `foreman-proxy-3.19`, `pulp-3.19`, `candlepin-3.19`.

---

## .tekton file management: Konflux owns this

The branching scripts do **not** generate, template, or patch `.tekton` files.

**Precondition:** nightly branches are always assumed to be working before a
release branch is cut. If nightly CI is broken, the release engineer raises it
in the release call and waits for the responsible team to fix it — branching a
broken nightly is not permitted.

**Branching flow:**

1. The versioned branch (e.g. `foreman-3.19`) is created from the nightly
   default branch. The existing `.tekton` files come along as-is — they are
   already correct and passing CI.
2. The Component manifest for the versioned release is applied to tenants-config
   (issue #29).
3. Konflux detects the new Component and automatically opens a PR on the versioned
   branch to update the `.tekton` files (target branch CEL expression, component
   name, service account, etc.) and takes over managing them from that point forward.

The branching script is only responsible for:
- Creating the git branch
- Patching `Containerfile` ARG defaults to pin the release version
- Committing, pushing, and opening a draft PR for human review

**What Konflux updates automatically** (for reference):

| Field | Nightly value | Versioned value (example: 3.19) |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| `metadata.name` | `foreman-develop-on-push` | `foreman-3.19-on-push` |
| `appstudio.openshift.io/component` | `foreman-develop` | `foreman-3.19` |
| CEL `target_branch` | `master` | `foreman-3.19` |
| CEL `.tekton` file reference | `foreman-develop-push.yaml` | `foreman-3.19-push.yaml` |
| `taskRunTemplate.serviceAccountName` | `build-pipeline-foreman-develop` | `build-pipeline-foreman-3.19` |
| `build-args` | _(not set; uses Containerfile defaults)_ | `FOREMAN_VERSION=3.19` (and `KATELLO_VERSION`) |
| `output-image` staging tag | `quay.io/foreman/foreman-stage:{{revision}}` | unchanged |

---

## Pipeline bundle schema note

The `.tekton` files pin every Tekton task bundle by digest
(`quay.io/..../task-foo@sha256:...`). The custom `buildah-oci-ta` task used by
this project is published at:

```
quay.io/foreman/tekton-catalog/task-buildah-oci-ta@sha256:<digest>
```

> **Note:** As of this writing, only `foreman-develop` and `foreman-proxy-develop`
> reference the custom bundle. `pulp-develop` and `candlepin-develop` still
> reference the upstream `quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/task-buildah-oci-ta`
> bundle. Migrating all repos to the custom bundle is tracked in issue #40.

When the custom bundle digest changes, open a PR to each affected OCI image
repository (nightly and all versioned branches) to update the digest. Use
`skopeo inspect` to get the current digest — see the main CLAUDE.md for the
exact command.
