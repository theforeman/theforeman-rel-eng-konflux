## The Foreman Release Engineering Konflux Artifacts

This repository contains YAML configuration files used to build, release, and maintain container images for [The Foreman](https://theforeman.org/) project using [Konflux](https://konflux.fedoraproject.org/).

### About Konflux

Konflux is an open-source CI/CD platform that provides secure software supply chain capabilities. The Foreman project uses Konflux to build container images with enhanced security through SLSA compliance, hermetic builds, and automated vulnerability scanning. For more details on this initiative, see the [RFC on evolving our container image builds](https://community.theforeman.org/t/rfc-evolving-our-container-image-builds/44990/).

### Prerequisites

To interact with the resources in this repository, you need:

1. A valid account in the [Fedora Account System (FAS)](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/)
2. Access permissions configured in the [tenant-config RBAC settings](https://gitlab.com/fedora/infrastructure/konflux/tenants-config/-/blob/main/cluster/kfluxfedorap01/theforeman-org-tenant/rbac.yaml)

### Repository Structure

- **`project/`** - Contains project definitions for Konflux. Each project represents one [application](https://konflux-ci.dev/docs/building/creating/) with its own configuration and build rules.

- **`releases/`** - Contains [ReleasePlan](https://konflux-ci.dev/docs/releasing/create-release-plan/) definitions for automated and point-in-time releases. Nightly releases are configured with auto-release enabled.

- **`docs/`** - Documentation including release logic and procedures.
